# Grafana-Monitoring
This documentation outlines the setup and management of a Data Processing Script designed to collect, process, and forward key system performance metrics for real-time visualization in Grafana. The script gathers performance data, transforms and aggregates metrics, and sends them to a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB or Prometheus), which Grafana then uses to generate dynamic dashboards for monitoring.
